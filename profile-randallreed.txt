Short Bio:
Born in Tennessee, raised in Virginia. Started writing programs on my TI-89 in high school. Majored in Computer Engineering in Virginia Tech and quickly realized I preferred software programming over hardware design. Worked in Boise, ID, Trinidad and Tobago, and Atlanta, GA before moving to NYC for the Flatiron School.
